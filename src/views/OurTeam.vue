                <br>Miriam graduated from the University of Sydney in 2011. 
                She has worked in several small animal clinics in both Adelaide and Sydney, and has also spent some time working for a 
                large animal health laboratory.
                <br>
                <br>Her veterinary interests lie in diagnostic imaging and internal medicine, but she is always keen to learn and expand 
                her experience in all fields. She has a particular soft spot for geriatric animals especially as she believes our pets often
                need more TLC as they get older. In her spare time, Miriam enjoys being active, yoga, amateur floristry, and going on long 
                bush walks with her Papillon dog, Pepper, who has been known to steal the occasional dumpling from the dinner table.
