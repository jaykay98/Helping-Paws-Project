        <h1>Ophthalmic</h1>
        <p class="text-justify">Ophthalmic surgery is the specific area of pet care involving treatment of an animalâ€™s eyes. For certain breeds, this service also involves the examination and certification of breeding dogs to verify their eyes are in good condition.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Eye examinations require specific equipment, such as an ophthalmoscope (a magnifying light to look into the eye). Our veterinarians may also use a special dye called fluorescein (it glows a green/yellow colour under a UV light) to identify damage to the cornea (the clear layer at the front of the eye). Many eye conditions can be treated medically, however, specific conditions may require surgery.</p>
        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Our practice is fully equipped to offer the following eye surgeries:</strong></p>
        <ul class="text-justify">
          <li>Enucleation (removal) of the eye for severe glaucoma or cancer cases</li>
          <li>Entropion surgery to prevent ocular damage from inward pointing eye lashes/eyelids</li>
          <li>Ectropion surgery to correct outward facing lower eyelids</li>
          <li>Eyelid tumour removal</li>
          <li>Cherry eye surgery to correct a protruding third eyelid in dogs</li>
          <li>Surgery to repair corneal ulcers (ulcers on the eye surface)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-justify">Our veterinarians can also refer your pet to a specialist veterinary ophthalmologist for specialised procedures such as eye ultrasound, vision testing or cataract removal.</p>
